# Migrating repositories from Bitbucket Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud

You can migrate repositories from Bitbucket Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud using the GitHub CLI.

## About repository migrations with GitHub Enterprise Importer

You can migrate individual repositories or all repositories from a BitBucket Server instance using GitHub CLI.

At this time, migrating from Bitbucket Server with the GitHub API is not supported.

If the destination organization or enterprise has rulesets enabled, the migrated repository's history may violate those rules. To allow the migration without disabling your rulesets, add "Repository migrations" to the bypass list for each applicable ruleset.  This bypass applies only during the migration. Once complete, rulesets will be enforced on all new contributions.

To configure the bypass:

1. Navigate to each enterprise or organization ruleset.
2. In the "Bypass list" section, click **Add bypass**.
3. Select **Repository migrations**.

For more information, see [Creating rulesets for repositories in your organization](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-branch-or-tag-ruleset) and [Setting ruleset bypasses for repository migrations](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/troubleshooting/setting-ruleset-bypasses-for-repository-migrations).

## Prerequisites

* We strongly recommend that you perform a trial run of your migration and complete your production migration soon after. To learn more about trial runs, see [Overview of a migration from Bitbucket Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/overview-of-a-migration-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud#running-your-migrations).
* Ensure you understand the data that will be migrated and the known support limitations of the Importer. For more information, see [About migrations from Bitbucket Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/about-migrations-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud).
* While not required, we recommend halting work during your production migration. The Importer doesn't support delta migrations, so any changes that happen during the migration will not migrate. If you choose not to halt work during your production migration, you'll need to manually migrate these changes.
* For the destination organization on GitHub.com, you must be an organization owner or have the migrator role. For more information, see [Managing access for a migration from Bitbucket Server](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/managing-access-for-a-migration-from-bitbucket-server#about-the-migrator-role).
* You need the username and password for a Bitbucket Server account with admin or super admin permissions.

## Step 1: Install the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI

If this is your first migration, you'll need to install the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI. For more information about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

Alternatively, you can download a standalone binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/github/gh-bbs2gh/releases) for the `github/gh-bbs2gh` repository. You can run this binary directly, without the `gh` prefix.

1. Install the GitHub CLI. For installation instructions for GitHub CLI, see the [GitHub CLI repository](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).

   > \[!NOTE]
   > You need version 2.4.0 or newer of GitHub CLI. You can check the version you have installed with the `gh --version` command.
2. Install the BBS2GH extension.

   ```shell copy
   gh extension install github/gh-bbs2gh
   ```

Any time you need help with the BBS2GH extension, you can use the `--help` flag with a command. For example, `gh bbs2gh --help` will list all the available commands, and `gh bbs2gh migrate-repo --help` will list all the options available for the `migrate-repo` command.

## Step 2: Update the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI

The BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI is updated weekly. To make sure you're using the latest version, update the extension.

```shell copy
gh extension upgrade github/gh-bbs2gh
```

## Step 3: Set environment variables

Before you can use the BBS2GH extension to migrate to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you must create a personal access token that can access the destination organization, then set the personal access token as an environment variable.

You'll also need to set environment variables for your Bitbucket Server username and password and, if your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows, your SMB password.

1. Create and record a personal access token (classic) that will authenticate for the destination organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud, making sure that the token meets all requirements. For more information, see [Managing access for a migration from Bitbucket Server](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/managing-access-for-a-migration-from-bitbucket-server#creating-a-personal-access-token-for-github-enterprise-importer).

2. Set environment variables, replacing TOKEN with the personal access token you recorded above, USERNAME with the username of a Bitbucket Server account that has admin or super admin permissions, and PASSWORD with the password for the Bitbucket Server account.

   * If you're using Terminal, use the `export` command.

     ```shell copy
     export GH_PAT="TOKEN"
     export BBS_USERNAME="USERNAME"
     export BBS_PASSWORD="PASSWORD"
     # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows
     export SMB_PASSWORD="PASSWORD"
     ```

   * If you're using PowerShell, use the `$env` command.

     ```shell copy
     $env:GH_PAT="TOKEN"
     $env:BBS_USERNAME="USERNAME"
     $env:BBS_PASSWORD="PASSWORD"
     # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows
     $env:SMB_PASSWORD="PASSWORD"
     ```

3. If you're migrating to GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, for convenience, set an environment variable for the **base API URL** for your enterprise.

   Ensure you replace `SUBDOMAIN` with your enterprise's subdomain. For example, if your enterprise's subdomain is `acme`, the `TARGET_API_URL` value would be `https://api.acme.ghe.com`.

   * If you're using Terminal, use the `export` command.

     ```shell copy
     export TARGET_API_URL="https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com"
     ```

   * If you're using PowerShell, use the `$env` command.

     ```shell copy
     $env:TARGET_API_URL="https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com"
     ```

   You'll use this variable with the `--target-api-url` option in commands you run with the GitHub CLI.

## Step 4: Set up blob storage

Because many Bitbucket Server instances sit behind firewalls, the GitHub CLI uses blob storage as an intermediate location to store your data that is reachable from the internet.

You will first generate an archive of the data you want to migrate and push the data to blob storage from behind your firewall.

The GitHub CLI supports the following blob storage providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3
* Azure Blob Storage

Before you can run a migration, you need to set up a storage container with your chosen cloud provider to store your data.

### Using GitHub-owned blob storage

If you do not want to set up and provide GitHub Enterprise Importer with access to a blob storage account behind your firewall, you can migrate repositories with GitHub-owned blob storage using the `--use-github-storage` flag. To do so, you must be running v1.9.0 (or higher) of BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI.

For security purposes, GitHub-owned blob storage is explicitly write-only, and downloads from GitHub-owned blob storage are not possible. After a migration is complete, the repository archives are immediately deleted. If an archive is uploaded and not used in a migration, the archive is deleted after 7 days.

### Setting up an AWS S3 storage bucket

In AWS, set up a S3 bucket. For more information, see [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) in the AWS documentation.

You will also need an AWS access key and secret key with the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::github-migration-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::github-migration-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

> \[!NOTE]
> GitHub Enterprise Importer does not delete your archive from AWS after your migration is finished. To reduce storage costs, we recommend configuring auto-deletion of your archive after a period of time. For more information, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html) in the AWS documentation.

When you're ready to run your migration, you will need to provide your AWS credentials to the GitHub CLI: region, access key, secret key, and session token (if required). You can pass them as arguments, or set environment variables called `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.

You will also need to pass in the name of the S3 bucket using the `--aws-bucket-name` argument.

### Setting up an Azure Blob Storage storage account

In Azure, create a storage account and make a note of your connection string. For more information, see [Manage storage account access keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#regenerate-access-keys) in Microsoft Docs.

> \[!NOTE]
> GitHub Enterprise Importer does not delete your archive from Azure Blob Storage after your migration is finished. To reduce storage costs, we recommend configuring auto-deletion of your archive after a period of time. For more information, see [Optimize costs by automatically managing the data lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview) in Microsoft Docs.

When you're ready to run your migration, you can either pass your connection string into the GitHub CLI as an argument, or pass it in using an environment variable called `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.

### Allowing network access

If you have configured firewall rules on your storage account, ensure you have allowed access to the IP ranges for your migration destination. See [Managing access for a migration from Bitbucket Server](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/managing-access-for-a-migration-from-bitbucket-server#ip-ranges-for-ghecom).

## Step 5: Migrate a repository

You can migrate repositories with the `gh bbs2gh migrate-repo` command.

When you migrate a repository, by default, the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI performs the following steps:

1. Connects to your Bitbucket Server instance and generates a migration archive per repository
2. Downloads the migration archive from the Bitbucket Server instance to the machine where you're running the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI, using SFTP (Linux) or SMB (Windows)
3. Uploads the migration archives to the blob storage provider of your choice
4. Starts your migration in GitHub Enterprise Cloud, using the URLs of the archives stored with your blob storage provider
5. Deletes the migration archive from your local machine. (You'll need to delete the archive from your blob storage provider manually once the migration has finished.)

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub CLI to generate the archive, download that archive manually, and then use the GitHub CLI to continue the migration.

* [Allowing the GitHub CLI to download the migration archive](#allowing-the-github-cli-to-download-the-migration-archive)
* [Downloading the migration archive manually](#downloading-the-migration-archive-manually)

### Allowing the GitHub CLI to download the migration archive

To migrate a single repository, use the `gh bbs2gh migrate-repo` command.

You must follow this step from a computer that can access:

* Your Bitbucket Server instance via HTTPS
* Your Bitbucket Server instance via SFTP, if your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Linux. In general, if you can access the server via SSH, then you can also use SFTP.
* Your Bitbucket Server instance via SMB, if your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows
* Your chosen blob storage provider

```shell copy
gh bbs2gh migrate-repo --bbs-server-url BBS-SERVER-URL \
  --bbs-project PROJECT --bbs-repo CURRENT-NAME \
  --github-org DESTINATION --github-repo NEW-NAME \
  # If you are migrating to GHE.com:
  --target-api-url TARGET-API-URL
  # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Linux:
  --ssh-user SSH-USER --ssh-private-key PATH-TO-KEY
  # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows:
  --smb-user SMB-USER
  # If you are using AWS S3 as your blob storage provider:
  --aws-bucket-name AWS-BUCKET-NAME
  # If you are running a Bitbucket Data Center cluster or your Bitbucket Server is behind a load balancer:
  --archive-download-host ARCHIVE-DOWNLOAD-HOST
  # If you are using GitHub owned blob storage:
  --use-github-storage
```

Replace the placeholders in the command above with the following values.

For information about how to troubleshoot these issues, see [Troubleshooting your migration with GitHub Enterprise Importer](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/troubleshooting-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer#cipher-name-is-not-supported).

### Downloading the migration archive manually

By default, the BBS2GH extension of the GitHub CLI performs the entire migration, including downloading the migration archive from the Bitbucket Server instance using SFTP or SMB.

However, some customers prefer to download the migration archive manually, because their server does not offer SFTP access, for example. In that case, you can use the GitHub CLI to generate the archive, download that archive manually, and then use the GitHub CLI to continue the migration.

You must follow this step from a computer that can access:

* Your Bitbucket Server instance via HTTPS
* Your chosen blob storage provider

First, use the `gh bbs2gh migrate-repo` command with only the following arguments:

```shell copy
gh bbs2gh migrate-repo --bbs-server-url BBS-SERVER-URL \
  --bbs-project PROJECT \
  --bbs-repo CURRENT-NAME
```

Replace the placeholders in the command above with the following values.

| Placeholder    | Value                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BBS-SERVER-URL | The URL for your Bitbucket Server instance                                     |
| PROJECT        | The key for the Bitbucket Server project of the repository you want to migrate |
| CURRENT-NAME   | The name of the repository you want to migrate                                 |

Your migration archive will be generated, and its path will be printed in the command output:

```text
[12:14] [INFO] Export completed. Your migration archive should be ready on your
instance at $BITBUCKET_SHARED_HOME/data/migration/export/Bitbucket_export_9.tar
```

In general, `$BITBUCKET_SHARED_HOME` will be set to `/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket/shared` on Linux and `C:\Atlassian\ApplicationData\Bitbucket\Shared` on Windows, but this may differ depending on your server configuration. To help you identify your shared home directory, see [Troubleshooting your migration with GitHub Enterprise Importer](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/troubleshooting-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer#source-export-archive-does-not-exist-error).

Download the migration archive from your Bitbucket Server instance, and store the archive on the machine where you're running the GitHub CLI.

To import your migration archive into GitHub, use the `gh bbs2gh migrate-repo` command again, with a different set of arguments:

```shell copy
gh bbs2gh migrate-repo --archive-path ARCHIVE-PATH \
  --github-org DESTINATION --github-repo NEW-NAME \
  --bbs-server-url BBS-SERVER-URL \
  --bbs-project PROJECT \
  --bbs-repo CURRENT-NAME \
  # If you are using AWS S3 as your blob storage provider:
  --aws-bucket-name AWS-BUCKET-NAME
  # If you are migrating to GHE.com:
  --target-api-url TARGET-API-URL
```

Replace the placeholders in the command above with the following values.

| Placeholder     | Value                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ARCHIVE-PATH    | The path to the Bitbucket Server migration archive you downloaded from your instance                      |
| DESTINATION     | Name of the destination organization                                                                      |
| NEW-NAME        | The name you want the migrated repository to have                                                         |
| BBS-SERVER-URL  | The URL for your Bitbucket Server instance                                                                |
| PROJECT         | The key for the Bitbucket Server project of the repository you want to migrate                            |
| CURRENT-NAME    | The name of the repository you want to migrate                                                            |
| AWS-BUCKET-NAME | The bucket name for your AWS S3 bucket                                                                    |
| TARGET-API-URL  | The base API URL for your enterprise's subdomain of GHE.com. For example: `https://api.octocorp.ghe.com`. |

### Cancelling a migration

If you want to cancel a migration, use the `abort-migration` command, replacing MIGRATION-ID with the ID returned from `migrate-repo`.

```shell copy
gh bbs2gh abort-migration --migration-id MIGRATION-ID
```

## Step 6: Validate your migration and check the error log

When your migration is complete, we recommend reviewing your migration log. For more information, see [Accessing your migration logs for GitHub Enterprise Importer](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/accessing-your-migration-logs-for-github-enterprise-importer). If your source repository contained rulesets and you're being blocked by them, see [Setting ruleset bypasses for repository migrations](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/troubleshooting/setting-ruleset-bypasses-for-repository-migrations).

We recommend that you review your migrated repositories for a soundness check.

## Step 7: Migrate multiple repositories

If you want to migrate multiple repositories to GitHub Enterprise Cloud at once, use the GitHub CLI to generate a migration script. The resulting script will contain a list of migration commands, one per repository.

> \[!NOTE]
> Generating a script outputs a PowerShell script. If you're using Terminal, you will need to output the script with the `.ps1` file extension and install PowerShell for either [Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2) to run it.

### Generating a migration script

You must follow this step from a computer that can access your Bitbucket Server instance via HTTPS.

To generate a migration script, run the `gh bbs2gh generate-script` command.

```shell copy
gh bbs2gh generate-script --bbs-server-url BBS-SERVER-URL \
  --github-org DESTINATION \
  --output FILENAME \
  # If you are migrating to GHE.com:
  --target-api-url TARGET-API-URL
  # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Linux:
  --ssh-user SSH-USER --ssh-private-key PATH-TO-KEY
  # If your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows:
  --smb-user SMB-USER
  # If you are running a Bitbucket Data Center cluster or your Bitbucket Server is behind a load balancer:
  --archive-download-host ARCHIVE-DOWNLOAD-HOST
  # If you are using GitHub owned blob storage:
  --use-github-storage
```

If you want the script to download the migration log for each migrated repository, add the `--download-migration-logs` flag. For more information about migration logs, see [Accessing your migration logs for GitHub Enterprise Importer](/en/enterprise-server@3.21/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/accessing-your-migration-logs-for-github-enterprise-importer#downloading-all-migration-logs-for-an-organization).

Replace the placeholders in the command above with the following values.

| Placeholder           | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Reviewing the migration script

After you generate the script, review the file and, optionally, edit the script.

* If there are any repositories you don't want to migrate, delete or comment out the corresponding lines.
* By default, repository names in GitHub will follow a `projectKey-repositoryName` convention. For example, a Bitbucket Server repository named `airports` that is part of the `open-source` project, which has the key `OS`, would be called `OS-airports` in GitHub. If you want any repositories to have a different name on GitHub, update the value for the corresponding `--github-repo` flag.

If you downloaded BBS2GH as a standalone binary rather than as an extension for the GitHub CLI, you will need to update your generated script to run the binary instead of `gh bbs2gh`.

### Running your migration script

To migrate your repositories, run the generated script.

You must follow this step from a computer that can access:

* Your Bitbucket Server instance via HTTPS
* Your Bitbucket Server instance via SFTP, if your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Linux. In general, if you can access the server via SSH, then you can also use SFTP.
* Your Bitbucket Server instance via SMB, if your Bitbucket Server instance runs on Windows
* Your chosen blob storage provider

Before running the script, you must set additional environment variables to authenticate to your blob storage provider.

* For AWS S3, set the following environment variables.
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The access key id for your bucket
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret key for your bucket
  * `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your bucket is located
  * `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: The session token, if you're using AWS temporary credentials (see [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html) in the AWS documentation)
* For Azure Blob Storage, set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` to the connection string for your Azure storage account.

Only connection strings using storage account access keys are supported. Connection strings which use shared access signatures (SAS) are not supported. For more information about storage account access keys, see [Manage storage account access keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#regenerate-access-keys) in the Azure documentation.

To migrate multiple repositories, run the script you generated. Replace FILENAME in the commands below with the filename you provided when generating the script.

* If you're using Terminal, use `./`.

  ```shell copy
  ./FILENAME
  ```

* If you're using PowerShell, use `.\`.

  ```shell copy
  .\FILENAME
  ```------
